    <h3>What is EXIF?</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchangeable_image_file_format">EXIF</a>
      is a type of metadata that is embedded in photo files from most types
      of cameras and phones.
    </p>

    <p>
      This metadata includes information about the device used to capture the photo,
      but also often includes the GPS coordinates of where the photo was taken.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many users unknowingly share this information with the general public
      and site/app owners when uploading photos online.
    </p>

    <p>
      This has been a common vector of privacy lapses, including cases where
      journalists have unintentionally published photos with geotagging data intact.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recent press has also revealed the NSA&rsquo;s collection of EXIF data in
      its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XKeyscore">XKeyscore</a> program.
    </p>

    <p>Here&rsquo;s an example of some EXIF geolocation data pulled from an iPhone photo:</p>
<pre>
GPS Latitude Ref      : North
GPS Longitude Ref     : West
GPS Altitude Ref      : Above Sea Level
GPS Time Stamp        : 17:34:20.54
GPS Img Direction Ref : True North
GPS Img Direction     : 273.6840149
GPS Altitude          : 60.1 m Above Sea Level
GPS Latitude          : 40 deg 41' 21.30" N
GPS Longitude         : 74 deg 2' 40.33" W
GPS Position          : 40 deg 41' 21.30" N, 74 deg 2' 40.33" W

    <h3>What is ExifExodus?</h3>
    <p>
      ExifExodus is a small piece of
      <a href="https://github.com/dmotz/ExifExodus">open-source code</a> that
      runs directly in your browser and strips EXIF data out of your photos before
      you upload them.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    <p>
      You can run ExifExodus whenever you&rsquo;re uploading photos by using its
      bookmarklet (available at the <a href="#bookmarklet">top</a> of this page).
    </p>

    <p>
      When ExifExodus encounters a JPG file, it will remove the EXIF data by
      copying the pixels to a new image file, similar to taking a screenshot of
      something.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, you can drop your files in the dropzone at the top of this
      page and receive versions free of EXIF data. You can then save these new
      files and upload them wherever you&rsquo;d like.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Is EXIF without merit?</h3>
    <p>
      That&rsquo;s certainly not the implication of this project. Metadata adds
      another dimension to photos and is valuable for preserving context.
      This project aims to educate and give users a choice in the matter of sharing
      it with specific services (and the web at large).
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Doesn&rsquo;t Facebook (etc.) remove EXIF data before displaying photos?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. Although this prevents the general public from accessing your EXIF data,
      you should be aware that the end recipient is free to use or store the metadata
      before removing it.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Any caveats?</h3>
    <p>
      The ExifExodus bookmarklet won&rsquo;t work with any site that uses Flash
      (or any other proprietary plugins like Silverlight) to upload files.
      For such sites, use the dropzone converter, save the output files, and upload
      those instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      ExifExodus only works with JPG files (which is the most common image
      format to carry EXIF metadata).
